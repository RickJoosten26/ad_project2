Input:
The first line has four numbers:
– The number of road intersections, 1 ≤ v ≤ 10000
– The number of pumping stations, 1 ≤ w ≤ min(v, 12)
– The number of roads, 1 ≤ e ≤ 30000
– The time limit, 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000

Each
pumping station can pump 200m3 water out of the polder per minute

Then follow w unique lines with a natural number of at most v
Next, there are e lines each containing three natural numbers. Each line
contains two road intersections represented as natural numbers of at most

Stap 1: graph initialization.
